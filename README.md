# Diabetes-Disease-Prediction-With-EDA


With Exploratory Data Analysis; The data set's structural data were checked. The types of variables in the dataset were examined. Size information of the dataset was accessed. The 0 values in the data set are missing values. Primarily these 0 values were replaced with NaN values. Descriptive statistics of the data set were examined.

Data Preprocessing section :  The NaN values missing observations were filled with the median values of whether each variable was sick or not. The outliers were determined by LOF and dropped. The X variables were standardized with the rubost method..

During Model Building; Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, CART, Random Forests, XGBoost, LightGBM like using machine learning models Cross Validation Score were calculated. Later Random Forests, XGBoost, LightGBM hyperparameter optimizations optimized to increase Cross Validation value.
